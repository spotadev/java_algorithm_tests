/**
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a specific given target number.
 * Given an array e.g. [1, 3, 6, 7, 9] and a target number say 10. Two numbers that add up to ten in the array and their
 * indices respectively are [1 and 9] at indices 0 and 5.
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 * [2, 3, 4, 5, 5] target = 7 --> numbers: 2 and 5, indices: 0 and 4
 * [1, 3, 5, 6, 2] target = 8 --> numbers: 5 and 3, indices: 1 and 2
 * [2, 3, 6, 8, 9] target = 9 --> numbers: 6 and 3, indices: 0 and 1
 * [9, 2, 4, 5, 6] target = 14 --> numbers: 5 and 9, indices: 0 and 4
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * Length of the array <= 1000000
 * Values of the array between -1000000000 and 10000000000
 * The array can be empty
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
