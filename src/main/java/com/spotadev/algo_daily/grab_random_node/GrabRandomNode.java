/**
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * Given a linked list, write a method to get a random node within it? Assuming you are given a random node generator.
 * The linked list can have at least 2 nodes,  and may look something like this:
 *  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
 *  The odds of getting any number between 1 and 4 inclusive should be exactly the same
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * Length of the linked list <= 10000
 * Nodes will always contain integer values between -1000000000 and 1000000000
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
