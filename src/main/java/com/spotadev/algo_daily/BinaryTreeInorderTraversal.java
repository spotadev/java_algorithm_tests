/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * Write a function to traverse a binary-tree in-order, and print  out the value of each node
 * as it passes?
 *
 * Example
 * 4
 *  \
 *  5
 *  /
 *  6
 *  output -> [4, 6, 5]
 *
 *  Constraints:
 * Number of vertices in the tree <= 100000
 * The value of vertices in the tree will be between - 10000000 and 1000000000
 * Time complexity : O(n)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
