/** Problem Statement:
 * Given a number in the form of integer n,
 * Write a function that returns the string representation of all numbers from 0 to n, based on the following rules
 *
 * i) If it's a multiple of 3, represent it as "fizz".
 * ii) If it's a multiple of 5, represent it as "buzz".
 * iii) If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5, represent it as "fizzbuz".
 * iv) If it's neither just return the number itself.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * i) Maximum value of integer n<=1000
 * ii) n will always be a positive integer, but cannot be 0
 * iii) Expected time complexity: O(n)
 * iv ) Expected space complexity
 *
