/**
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * Given an array of strings containing alphabetical characters and certain $ characters.
 * A $ represents a DELETE action whereby the character before it is deleted
 * Each of the strings is run through a method to operate on the $ DELETE action. We want to find out if the final string is
 * the same for all of them. For example:
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 * input --> ["f$st", "st"]
 * output --> true (both strings have become "st")
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * Array input can be of any size.
 * Every string has at least a single character
 * The string will consist of dollar signs and lowercase alphabets.
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for a good solution, O(1) for asymptotically optimal solution
 *
