/** 
 * https://algodaily.com/challenges/fizz-buzz
 * 
 * Given a number in the form of integer n, write a function that returns the string 
 * representation of all numbers from 0 to n, based on the following rules
 *
 *     i)   If it's a multiple of 3, represent it as "fizz".
 *     ii)  If it's a multiple of 5, represent it as "buzz".
 *     iii) If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5, represent it as "fizzbuz".
 *     iv)  If it's neither just return the number itself.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 
 *     i)   Maximum value of integer n<=1000
 *     ii)  n will always be a positive integer, but cannot be 0
 *     iii) Expected time complexity: O(n)
 *     iv ) Expected space complexity
