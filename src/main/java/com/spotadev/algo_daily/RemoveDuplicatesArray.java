/**
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * Given an array, return another array with just he ordered unique elements from the given array i.e. remove the
 * duplicate values from the array.
 * N/B: No sorting is allowed since the order of the elements has to be preserved. Order should be maintained with teh
 * first occurrence of the element in the given array.
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 * input : [1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2,] --> output : [1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 2]
 * input: [2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 1, 1, 7, 8] --> output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 7]
 * input: [3, 5, 6, 9, 4, 3, 12] --> output: [3, 5, 6, 9, 4, 12]
 * input: [13, 5, 3, 5, 8, 13, 14, 5, 9] --> output: [13, 5, 3, 8, 14, 9]
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * Length of the array <= 100000
 * Values in between the array -1000000000 and 1000000000
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
