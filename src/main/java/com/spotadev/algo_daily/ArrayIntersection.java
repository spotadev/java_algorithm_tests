/**
 * Problem:
 * Write a function that takes two arrays as input and returns the intersection of the two arrays as output. Return the intersection of the two inputs in the form of an
 * array.
 * An intersection of two sets A and B is consists of all elements found in A that are also belong to B.
 *
 * Examples
 * A = [1, 3, 4, 5,] and B= [2, 3]
 * intersection(A, B) --> [2,3]
 *
 * num1 = [3, 5, 6, 7] amd num2 = [5, 6, 8]
 * intersection(num1, num2) ---> [5, 6]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * Length of the array <= 100000
 * Values in array range from -1000000000 to 1000000000
 * Time Complexity : O(n+m) where n and m are the lengths of the two arrays
 * Space Complexity: O(max(n, m))
