/** PROBLEM STATEMENT
 * Given an array of integers , e.g. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
 * Imagine this is an assembly line, the decision is made to shift some workers around.
 * This is achieved by rotating the array at a random pivot so that the section after the pivot
 * comes before.
 * Example, a pivot between 5 and 6 would give:
 * [6, 7, 8, 0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * Find the smallest element in O(n log n), assuming there are no repeating numbers>
 *
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * Length of array <= 100000
 * Values of the array will be between -1000000000 and 1000000000
 * Time Complexity: O (log n)
 * Space Complexity: O (1)
 *
