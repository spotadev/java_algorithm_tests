/**
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * Given an array of continuous numbers that should increment sequentially by 1, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 * However there are some missing numbers.
 * [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
 * Write a method missingNumbers that takes an array of continuous variables and returns the missing integers
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 * input: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8] --> output: [3, 5, 7]
 * input: [2, 4, 5, 6] --> output
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * Length of the array <= 100000
 * Array will always contain non-negative integers excluding zero
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
