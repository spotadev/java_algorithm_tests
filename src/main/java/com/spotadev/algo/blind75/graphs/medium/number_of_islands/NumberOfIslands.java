/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/
 * 
 * Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), 
 * return the number of islands.
 * 
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or 
 * vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 *     Input: 
 *         grid = [
 *             ["1","1","1","1","0"],
 *             ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 *             ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *             ["0","0","0","0","0"]
 *         ]
 *      
 *      Output: 1
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 *     Input: 
 *         grid = [
 *            ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *            ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *            ["0","0","1","0","0"],
 *            ["0","0","0","1","1"]
 *         ]
 * 
 *     Output: 3
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 *     m == grid.length
 *     n == grid[i].length
 *     1 <= m, n <= 300
 *     grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
