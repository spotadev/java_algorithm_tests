/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/
 * 
 * Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the 
 * grid.
 * 
 * The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells 
 * are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 *     Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
 *     Output: true
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 *     Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
 *     Output: true
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 *     Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
 *     Output: false
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 *     m == board.length
 *     n = board[i].length
 *     1 <= m, n <= 6
 *     1 <= word.length <= 15
 *     board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
 * 
 *  Follow up: Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger board?
