 * https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/
 * 
 * Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.
 * 
 * Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent 
 * cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more 
 * than once in a word.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 *     Input: 
 * 
 *         board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], 
 *         words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
 *         
 *     Output: 
 * 
 *         ["eat","oath"]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *  
 *     Input: 
 *     
 *         board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
 *     
 *     Output: []
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 *     m == board.length
 *     n == board[i].length
 *     1 <= m, n <= 12
 *     board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.
 *     1 <= words.length <= 3 * 104
 *     1 <= words[i].length <= 10
 *     words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
 *     All the strings of words are unique.
