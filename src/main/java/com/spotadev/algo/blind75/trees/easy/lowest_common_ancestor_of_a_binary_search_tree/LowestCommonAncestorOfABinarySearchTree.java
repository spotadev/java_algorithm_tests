 * 
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes 
 * in the BST.
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between 
 * two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a 
 * node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * 
 * Example 1: 
 * 
 *     Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
 *     Output: 6
 *     Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *     Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
 *     Output: 2
 *     Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself 
 *     according to the LCA definition.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 *
 *     Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
 *     Output: 2 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 *     The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
 *     -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
 *     All Node.val are unique.
 *     p != q
 *     p and q will exist in the BST.
